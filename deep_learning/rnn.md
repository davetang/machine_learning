# Recurrent Neural Network

From ChatGPT.

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed to model sequential data and handle input of arbitrary length. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which process input data in a single pass without any memory, RNNs have connections that allow them to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. This memory property makes them well-suited for tasks involving sequences, such as time series prediction, natural language processing, speech recognition, and handwriting recognition.

The key characteristic of RNNs is their ability to maintain a state or memory of previous inputs while processing the current input. This is achieved through recurrent connections, where the output of the network at a given time step is fed back as input to the network at the next time step.

Here's a high-level overview of the structure and functioning of a simple RNN:

1. **Recurrent Connections**:
    - At each time step $t$, an RNN takes an input $x_t$ and produces an output $y_t$ and an internal state $h_t$.
    - The internal state $h_t$ is computed based on the current input $x_t$ and the previous internal state $h_{t-1}$.
    - Mathematically, the internal state $h_t$ is computed as $h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1})$, where $f$ is a non-linear activation function applied to a combination of the current input and the previous state.

2. **Sequence Processing**:
    - RNNs can process input sequences of arbitrary length. They operate recursively, with each time step processing one element of the sequence.
    - The output of the RNN at each time step can be used for prediction, classification, or further processing.

3. **Training**:
    - RNNs are typically trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT), an extension of the backpropagation algorithm adapted for sequences.
    - BPTT involves unfolding the network over time and calculating gradients through time, allowing the network to learn from the entire sequence.

While RNNs have demonstrated success in modeling sequential data, they suffer from some limitations, such as difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies and vanishing or exploding gradients during training, especially in deep networks. To address these issues, various RNN variants have been developed, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which incorporate mechanisms to better capture long-term dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. These variants have become widely used in practice for tasks involving sequential data.
