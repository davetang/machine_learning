A list of useful references (saved here for prosperity).

* [Feature Selection, Extraction, and Construction](fdws02.pdf) by Hiroshi Motoda and Huan Liu.
    * Feature selection is a process that chooses a subset of `M` features from the original set of `N` features.
    * Feature extraction is a process that extracts a set of new features from the original features through functional mapping.
    * Feature construction is a process that discovers missing information about the relationships between features and augments the space of features by inferring or creating new features.
